****************
* Requirements *
****************

Java      Standard Edition version 1.2 or greater - Micro Edition has not been tested but may work
ANT       http://jakarta.apache.org/ant (make sure to get the optional.jar file!)

GCC development tools (make, gcc, ld, etc...)

*********
* Build *
*********

The ANT tool uses XML buildfiles to create the project.  Run ant in
the toplevel directory to list all available targets.  To build the RI,
use the "all" target which compiles all classes and creates the jarfiles.

****************
* Installation *
****************

Add the class jarfile (or class destination directory) to your CLASSPATH.
Copy the native library to a location where your dynamic loader will find it
(i.e., either your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or directory listed in /etc/ld.so.conf)
